- Mobile App Error Handling (0%)
	- Request time out should be handled (unreachable host)
	- Localisation activation on the login page should be handled
	- Global error handling to avoid crash
- Flutter does not have a way to parse response data from API directly to a dart object, so careful when changing the ApiResponse structure
- Remove refresh token for CCID and manager (make CCID token expiration to something higher, like 7 days)
- Server logging
